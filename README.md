# BenjaminProblem
An alien appears before number theorists Samantha and Peter and says "I am thinking of 2 integers X and Y such that 3 <= X <= Y <= 97 and I'll tell Samantha the sum and I will tell Peter the Product". Then the alien goes away. The following conversation transpires:
Samantha: You do not know what X and Y are.
Peter: That was true, but I know them now.
Samantha: And now I know the numbers as well.
Determine X and Y
